This assignment is an RPC experiment, divided into the following parts, RPC principle, experimental environment, experimental details, source code and conclusion.
\end{abstract}

\section{RPC principle}\label{sec:rpc-principle}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item {
    Remote procedure call (RPC) is a technology used to build distributed, client-server based applications.
    It is based on extending the conventional local procedure calling so that the called procedure need not exist in the same address space as the calling procedure.
  }
  \item {
    Figure~\ref{fig:rpc} is the model of remote procedure call.
    \begin{figure}[htp]

        \includegraphics[width=10cm]{rpc}
        \caption{Remote procedure call model}
        \label{fig:rpc}
    \end{figure}
  }
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental environment}\label{sec:experimental-environment}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item {
    The programming language used in the experiment program is Python, and the version is 3.7.
  }
  \item {
    The RPC package used in the experimental program is RPyC. RPyC (pronounced like are-pie-see), or Remote Python Call, is a transparent library for symmetrical remote procedure calls, clustering, and distributed-computing. RPyC makes use of object-proxying, a technique that employs pythonâ€™s dynamic nature, to overcome the physical boundaries between processes and computers, so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they were local.
  }
  \item {
    The client is deployed on macOS. Figure~\ref{fig:client_sysinfo} shows the system information.
    \begin{figure}[htp]

        \includegraphics[width=10cm]{client_sysinfo}
        \caption{Client system information}
        \label{fig:client_sysinfo}
    \end{figure}
  }
  \item {
    The server is deployed in the docker container of an Azure server in the US. Figure~\ref{fig:server_sysinfo} shows the system information.
    \begin{figure}[htp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=10cm]{server_sysinfo}

    \end{figure}
  }
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
After testing, I found that the average response time of the client calling the function in the server depends on the following two factors:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item How much data is transmitted in the communication process
  \item The running time of the function called remotely
\end{enumerate}
